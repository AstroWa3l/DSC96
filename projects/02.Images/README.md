# Week 5: Images

Data comes in many forms.  Over the next few weeks we will be looking at images, unstructured text (tweets), and audio recordings.

By the end of this week you will:
* Understand how digital images are stored,
* Be able to manipulate images with python (crop, thubmnail, grayscale), and
* Write basic algorithms for edge detection and manipulation (photoshop) detection.

This week we transition from Tableau to Python, which we will be using for the rest of the quarter.
