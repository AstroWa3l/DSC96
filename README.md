## Description

This sequence of projects familiarizes the you with the process of
answering questions using data. The projects are hands-on and
open-ended.  They are meant to be completed first using Tableau
(Project 1), then Jupyter notebooks (Projects 2-4). The projects
attempt to answer the three big questions:
* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* What will happen?
They use a variety of data types and exposes you to
data's limitations and messiness.

By the time you finish this class, you will be able to:
* Identify problems that are good candidates for data science,
* Reframe the problem in a way that can be answered with the available data,
* Evaluate the limitations and quirks of the data,
* Manipulate the data to answer relevant questions, and
* Communicate the results clearly.

## How this class works
This class operates as a data science lab class, meaning that the bulk
of time in class is spent doing data science.  Formal lectures will be
minimal, and meant to help you understand the tasks and the context.

Unless we get behind, there should not be mandatory coding or
analytics work outside of class (though you are encouraged to expand
on the projects and see how much you can do!).  There is significant
reading outside of class, and it is important to keep up with the
reading because of the limited formal instruction during class time.

## PROJECTS
Projects are worked on during class and must be turned in to the
instructor via email by the due date below.  Please include "[CSE 91
Fa18 Project]" in the subject line and attach Tableau workbook or
Jupyter notebook. You should not need to work on the projects outside
of class, but are encouraged to expand on the project and clean up the
presentation if you are motivated. A little extra work can make a
great project to show off on your resume.

### Due Dates:
SDPD traffic stops Tableau project (Due 10/23)
Favorite of the "why did it happen?" (Due 11/20)
SDPD traffic stops final project (Due 12/06)

## Reading journals
Each week, at least 24 hours before the start of the Thursday class,
you must write me a paragraph or two about the weekly reading and send
it via a private note in Piazza. The goal of this
is to have a more in-depth conversation than our class time
allows. Think of these journals more as emails to discuss something
you read with a colleague than as a formal essay.

The topic is up to you, but examples include:

* Relating a topic in the reading to something in your life or in the news,
* Asking a thoughtful question about the reading, or
* Picking a quote from the reading that you agree or disagree with and explaining why.

I may bring up what you write to me in class unless you explicitly ask
me in that email not to.

### Assigned readings (journal material)

There are loosely related readings scheduled concurrently with the
projects, intended to get you thinking about larger issues in data
science. These are found in the `readings.md` file in each project.
