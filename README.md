Introductory workshop: asking questions about data

Rough Draft. Created with / Forked from Colin Jemmott.

## Description

This sequence of projects familiarizes the you with the process of
answering questions using data. The projects are hands-on and
open-ended.  They are meant to be completed first using Tableau
(Project 1), then Jupyter notebooks (Projects 2-4). The projects
attempt to answer the three big questions:
* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* What will happen?
They use a variety of data types and exposes you to
data's limitations and messiness.

By the time you finish this class, you will be able to:
* Identify problems that are good candidates for data science,
* Reframe the problem in a way that can be answered with the available data,
* Evaluate the limitations and quirks of the data,
* Manipulate the data to answer relevant questions, and
* Communicate the results clearly.

## Materials

### Projects 

The projects are in numbered order:

0. [Getting Started](./projects/00.Getting_Started)
1. [Traffic Stops](./projects/01.Traffic_Stops)
2. [Images](./projects/02.Images)
3. [Audio](./projects/03.Audio)
4. [Unstructured Text](./projects/04.Text)
5. [AB Testing](./projects/05.AB_Testing)
6. [Prediction](./projects/06.Prediction)

### Readings

There are loosely related readings scheduled concurrently with the
projects, intended to get you thinking about larger issues in data
science. These are found in the `readings.md` file in each project.
